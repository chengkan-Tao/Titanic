The article focuses on how to avoid spending time on problems that have been solved before, better and on a larger scale. This will reduce time on messy codes and increase time on research problems.
1 A script that executes all codes from beginning and end can help us save a lot of time when researchers need to reproduce the regression. They donâ€™t have to run all steps.
2 Keeping everything under version control allows researchers to overwrite changes in any cases.
3 Using modular, functional directories to organize code can help researchers modify the analysis without re-running the data build.
4 Store cleaned data in tables with non-missing keys and keep data normalized. Structure data well makes data clear.
5 Abstraction can reduce superfluous codes and errors when researchers are coding.  
6 Researchers can write code to be self-documenting without unnecessary comments and notes.
7 A task manage system is important in collaborative work.
These methods help a lot. First, these elements save time. I just find my script instead of go through so many steps. Second, a complex way usually leads people in wrong direction. I find difficult running my code. When editing my data, I name my dataset by just a number. It caused me a lot of trouble when I want to go back. I cannot find my raw data. So, it is necessary to name properly and script key steps when I write my code and switch to LaTeX.


Git is a distributed version control system. Git can be used locally when computer is not connected to the Internet. Its function is to manage program better. For example, although people modify the content, git can reproduce the original content before change. If I am aware of wrong changes I submitted before, I can find my original code. It is a new one for me, and I am not completely familiar with it.
Github is a website where people can submit codes and files. Others can see your codes and modify.
